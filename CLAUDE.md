# Shipmate Prototype — Claude Context

## What This Is

Shipmate is a web app that helps game developers prepare and submit their games to app stores (iOS App Store, Google Play, Steam, Epic, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo). It walks developers through content ratings, data collection disclosures, business categories, screenshots, and binary analysis — using AI to infer answers where possible.

This is a **static HTML/CSS/JS prototype** hosted on GitHub Pages. There is no build system, no npm, no bundler. Everything runs directly in the browser.

Current version: **v5.32**

## File Architecture

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | App shell, modals markup, script/style tags |
| `splash.html` | Splash/loading screen (loaded in an iframe) |
| `style.css` | All styles |
| `state.js` | Global `state` object — single source of truth |
| `render.js` | Pure rendering functions (`buildXxx`, `renderXxx`) — never mutate state |
| `app.js` | Event handlers, state mutations, initialization |
| `claude.js` | Claude API wrapper (streaming inference) |
| `locale.js` | i18n string lookup helper |
| `locales/` | JSON translation files per language |
| `Assets/` | Images (logos, icons) |
| `config.js` | **GITIGNORED** — real API keys live here, never committed |

## Key Code Patterns

### State
All app data lives in the global `state` object defined in `state.js`. Render functions read from it; app.js mutates it. Never mutate state inside render functions.

```js
// Reading state
state.platforms['ios'].screenshots

// Mutating state (in app.js)
state.platforms['ios'].screenshots.push(newShot);
renderDashboard();
```

### Render vs App split
- `render.js` — builds HTML strings, attaches inline event handlers, returns or sets innerHTML
- `app.js` — handles all user interactions, calls render functions to update DOM after mutations

### Platform IDs
`ios`, `android`, `steam`, `epic`, `psn`, `xbox`, `switch`

### CSS 3D flip animation
Platform cards flip between views using CSS 3D transforms. Classes:
- `is-flip-exit` (160ms) — current face rotates out
- `is-flip-enter` (300ms) — new face rotates in

Use `openStorePreviewSection(pid, target)` to trigger a flip. It handles the 3-phase async sequence (flip exit → inference loading with 2s minimum → flip enter).

### Screenshot crop state
Per-platform crop state is tracked in `_shotCropState[pid]`:
```js
{ shotId, src, name, aspect, panX, panY }
```
Pan position is preserved between device preset changes. Reset pan when a new screenshot is dropped.

### Store preview section tracking
`state.storePreviewSectionSeen[pid][target]` tracks whether a user has visited a section. Required for gating "done" state — a section isn't complete until both visited AND data is filled.

### Versioning — required on every change

Every set of changes must increment the version number. Current version: **v5.32** → next is **v5.33**, then **v5.34**, etc.

Update the version in **three places**:
1. `index.html` — all `?v=X.XX` cache-bust params on script/style tags
2. `index.html` — the build badge div: `<div class="build-badge">vX.XX</div>`
3. `splash.html` — the version badge text and the iframe `src="splash.html?v=X.XX"`

Always include the new version number in the git commit message, e.g. `"v5.32 — add tooltip to age rating cell"`.

## Security — Read This First

`config.js` is gitignored. It contains real API keys and must never be committed.

```js
// config.js (gitignored — never commit)
const CONFIG = {
  CLAUDE_API_KEY:     'sk-ant-...',
  IGDB_CLIENT_ID:     '...',
  IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET: '...',
};
```

The repo contains placeholder keys in `index.html`:
```js
const CONFIG = {
  CLAUDE_API_KEY:     '__CLAUDE_API_KEY__',
  IGDB_CLIENT_ID:     '__IGDB_CLIENT_ID__',
  IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET: '__IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET__',
};
```

**Never replace these placeholders in index.html with real keys.** Real keys go in `config.js` only.

API keys are injected automatically by GitHub Actions at deploy time — contributors do not need a local `config.js`.

## Git Workflow

**Claude must NOT run any git command in this repo — no `git add`, `commit`, `pull`,
`push`, `gc`, or `maintenance`, and no `rm` of `.git/*.lock`.** The Cowork sandbox is
denied permission to delete files inside `.git` (even ones git itself just created),
so any git operation Claude runs leaves stale `.git/*.lock` files and half-written
`.git/objects/tmp_obj_*` behind. Those leftovers then break the human's `./ship.sh`.
This was the cause of the recurring "index.lock: File exists" failures.

Division of labor:
- **Claude** edits files only, and bumps the version number (see Versioning). Claude
  never commits. When done, Claude tells the contributor to run `./ship.sh`.
- **The contributor** runs everything git via `./ship.sh` from a real terminal (which
  *can* clean up `.git`, and self-heals any stale locks on startup).

Typical workflow:
1. Describe changes to Claude in Cowork — Claude edits the files (no git).
2. Test locally: `python3 -m http.server 8080` → open `http://localhost:8080`
3. Publish: `./ship.sh "v5.xx — description of change"` (commits, pulls, pushes).

GitHub Pages auto-deploys from `main` within ~30 seconds of a push.

Include the version number in the ship note: `./ship.sh "v5.32 — description of change"`.

---

## Testing

Run a local server — opening `index.html` directly in a browser won't work properly (scripts and the splash iframe won't load):

```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`. Leave the Terminal window running while testing.

AI inference features won't work locally (keys are injected at deploy time). All UI and navigation works without them.

## Active Tasks / Known Issues

See GitHub Issues for the current backlog. As of v5.32, the following items are in the queue:

- **Mac App Store preview for the demo** — adapt it to how the real Mac App
  Store looks. macOS already exists as a platform (`macos` / `macos_full`), and
  `SM_REQS.macos` in assets.js already carries Apple's numbers: icon 1024×1024
  with no alpha, screenshots 16:10 at 2880×1800 / 2560×1600 / 1440×900 /
  1280×800. The web preview (`buildWebSitePreviewSection` + web-page.js) is the
  most developed one and the best model to copy.
- Auto-fit the hero on mobile: a logotype sized for 1440px overflows at 390px.
  Needs to happen in the measuring pass, re-anchored by the edge it aligns to.
- Press kit — Adam wants a downloadable one with asset links. Blocked on a real
  question rather than a design one: there is no publish path at all, and the
  assets are data URLs or Steam CDN links.
- T4: Sync data type selections from natural language description (state.js task #4)

## Pending AI Model Decision

The team is evaluating which AI model to use for production inference. A benchmark spec is in `shipmate-ai-benchmark-spec.md`. Current leading candidate: **Claude Sonnet 5** for real-time inference. Open-weight fine-tuning (Qwen2.5-32B range) is a future option once sufficient labeled data is collected.
