### The release block (VERSION / BUILD / TRACK)

`buildReleaseBlock()` in render.js. Two rows: what was uploaded, then where it
goes. Every number in it is derived from a constraint rather than picked —

- The label column is **`max-content` + a 14px gap**, so the row's own label
  binds to its value at the same 14 `.rel-pair` uses inside the line. It was a
  fixed 62px, which bought values starting at 97 on every card — but it left
  "VERSION" ending 15.8px short of the column edge, so that first gap measured
  **29.8 against the pair's 14**: two different bindings for one relationship,
  and "VERSION" read as a heading over the row instead of as the name of the
  value beside it. Now measured 14 and 14, with 30 still separating the two
  pairs. The cost, paid knowingly: values no longer share an x across cards
  (~12px between a Steam card, which starts at BUILD, and an iOS one). The old
  note said `auto` was "wrong across a grid" — that was written when the row
  was pure text and its left edge was the only thing lining anything up. Since
  shape 4 the row's shared line is the **picker's right edge**, and the labels
  still all start on 21, the card's one real vertical edge.
- `.rel-version { min-width: calc(4ch + 25px) }` caps the gap from the end of
  the version text to the "B" of BUILD at **55px**. That gap is
  `(column − text) + 30` (14px row gap + 16px pair margin) and is widest when
  the text is narrowest, a four-character `v1.0`. In `ch` because the face is
  monospace — 1ch *is* the character advance — so the cap survives a size
  change.
- The track pill is pulled **−14px** so its *text* lands on the value column
  while its box hangs into the label gap. The opposite fix (indenting the text
  +14 to meet the pill) moved every value in the block to accommodate one
  control's padding.
- Labels are **white at 34%**, not `--ob-label-color`'s 72%. They name a value
  and get out of the way. Scoped to `.rel-label`, not by repointing the token —
  that token is Game Details' section headers, where the label *is* the
  heading of a field.
- **No middot and no date.** "v1.0 · 2 days ago" reads as machine-assembled
  metadata; the gap separates the facts instead. The date answered neither
  question the header asks and is the only value nobody can act on. It belongs
  on a build inside a list of builds. `uploadedAt` is still stamped on every
  upload, so nothing needs re-modelling for that.
- The pill is a **ghost trigger** whose hover box is the header buttons' hover
  box — 30px, 8px radius, `var(--surface-hover, rgba(255,255,255,.06))`, no
  stroke. Same kind of object: a control that shows nothing until you go near
  it, living in the card's chrome rather than in a form. The masked `::after`
  ring is switched off with `display: none` scoped to `.rel-track`, so
  Localization's copy of the same pill keeps its ring.

**Stores model this channel → build, not build → channel**, and that is
verified against vendor docs, not remembered. Apple: groups hold their own
build lists, added one at a time ("You can add only one build at a time"), and
internal groups do not auto-receive builds unless automatic distribution is on
— so build 41 on external while 42 is on internal is normal. Builds expire at
90 days. Google: tracks run concurrently, but a lower versionCode on a test
track is *inert*, because a device gets "the highest version code published
across those tracks" and the Console flags it Shadowed. Steam: any of the last
50 builds can be set live on any branch. The current block still shows one
build → one destination; the parallel state needs the build list.
