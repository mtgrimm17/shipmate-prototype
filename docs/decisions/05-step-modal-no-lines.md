### The step modal has no lines

The shell is `renderStepModal()` (render.js) and its `.submit-modal-*` rules in
style.css. Four changes in v6.11, all of them taken from the questionnaire
prototype's Improve modal rather than invented:

- **The header and footer draw no borders.** A modal that rules a line under its
  header and over its footer is three stacked boxes; content dissolving into
  them is one surface with more of itself above and below. The line is replaced
  by `.submit-modal-fade-top` / `-bottom`, absolutely positioned over
  `.submit-modal-body-wrap` (the scroller's new parent — it took the flex sizing
  so every rule that targets `.submit-modal-scroll`, `.submit-modal-mac-spp`'s
  included, still applies).
- **A fade only shows while there is more content that way.** `_smModalFades()`
  (app.js) toggles `at-top` / `at-bottom` and is re-armed after *every* render,
  because the modal is rebuilt with innerHTML and the old scroller's listener
  goes with it. Two traps it already pays for: **a taller content is not a
  scroller** — the Mac Product Page Preview hands scrolling to `.mac-spp-main`
  and leaves this element `overflow: hidden` with tall content, which pinned the
  bottom fade on and washed out the footer nav, so the overflow is asked before
  the heights; and the wrapper ships with **both classes already on** so a short
  body never flashes a fade on its first paint.
- **The glyph wears no well** (`.submit-modal-hicon`), exactly as the platform
  cards dropped theirs in v5.72 and for the same reason. The 40px slot stays so
  the title column cannot shift between platforms; the glyph is sized in CSS at
  34px, never by `platformIcon()`'s size argument.
- **The × is the platform card's gear**: 30px, no border, 8px radius, bare until
  hover, then `--surface-hover`. Changed on `.task-modal-close` itself, so all
  five modals that use it close the same way.
- **The footer button is the app's pill.** `.imp-cta` was unscoped from
  `.improve-v2` — it is the onboarding "Continue" pill, and the step modal wears
  it too, so it cannot live inside one section's namespace. Improve's variants
  (`data-imp-act`, `.iv-bin-actions`) stay scoped and still outrank it.

The base modal is **680px** (638 of content was crowding its own padding); the
wide variants are sized by what they hold and did not move. `.step-modal-group
.submit-modal`'s flex-basis has to track that number.

**Content Rating went up a size with it.** It was the densest type in the app —
13px questions, 11px section headers, 9px tooltip handles, and answer pills at
10px/700 uppercase with 0.8px of tracking — and it is the step read most
carefully, because every row is a legal declaration. Now: question 14, section
header 12, pill 12/500, handle 10 in a 16px disc (scoped to the question row;
`.tooltip-icon` is app-wide and stays 15/9 elsewhere).

The pills read **"Yes" / "No" / "Frequent"** without a single markup change:
`text-transform: lowercase` on the button, `::first-letter { uppercase }` over
it. CSS cannot sentence-case an already-uppercase string in one pass, but
`::first-letter` is a second pass — and "YES" is written literally at fourteen
call sites (content rating plus Game Center on three platforms), one of which
would certainly have been missed by hand.

**The section headers lost their rule and the questions gained an indent.** A
line under "FEATURES" said "a group starts here" with a graphic element, on a
surface that had just lost the header's and the footer's own lines; position
says it more quietly. Questions sit 12px in (`.ios-q-label`'s padding, NOT the
row's — indenting the row carries the answer pills with it and narrows the row,
where this leaves them anchored 88px from the right edge, and leaves the amber
validation rail on the row's own edge, 12px outside the text). The header's
margins absorbed what the border was holding up: 22/10 for 20/8 plus 5 of
padding-bottom, or it lands flush on its first question. Measured: header at 24,
both question families at 36, pills at 88 from the right.

Rows sit **8px** apart and the pills inside a row **6px** (both `.question-yn`
and `.intensity-group`, which were at 4). At 6 and 4 the two rhythms were close
enough that a row did not read as one unit. Costs 32px of scroll on the whole
step and no row per screen.

Their widths are held equal by hand, and the padding is the lever: **yes / no /
none all measure 52×32**, with `min-width: 52` doing the deciding and the
horizontal padding (13 for `.yn-btn`, 10 for `.intensity-btn`) pulled in far
enough that no label overshoots the floor. Those two numbers track the type —
change the size or the weight and they have to be re-measured, which is what
happened twice in one afternoon here.

**The filter travels with the list it filters.** The Unanswered / All switch
and the "Shipmate inferred X of Y" line are read against the rows below them,
and thirty rows down both had scrolled away. They are now one `.cr-pinned` bar,
`position: sticky` — sticky rather than moved into the modal's header, because
this section also renders inline in Game Details' Content Questions pane, where
there is no header to move it into.

Four things that bar had to be taught, all of them measured:

- **Sticky measures from the MARGIN box.** With the scroller's own top padding
  still in place the bar came to rest 6px below the scrollport and rows slid
  through the strip between it and the title. The scroller now gives up its top
  padding whenever a pinned bar is present (`:has(.cr-pinned)`) and the bar pays
  it back as padding of its own — opaque, so nothing can leak through, and the
  gap above it is identical at rest and pinned (11px, or 17 from the title).
- **Its padding is one number** (7px). The selected half is a filled pill
  against the box's edge, so the gap around it reads as a frame; 6 top/bottom
  against 12 left made that frame twice as wide on one side.
- **The radii nest**: 13 on the selected half, +3 of track padding = 16 on the
  toggle's own rail, +7 of box padding = 23 on the bar. Each curve concentric
  with the one outside it.
- **The fade hangs from the bar's bottom edge** (`.cr-pinned::after`, 36px) and
  the modal's own top fade is switched off while a pinned bar exists. A fade has
  to be longer than what crosses it — a row is 34px — so the first try at 18px
  did most of its ramp in eight and read as a hard cut with a smudge on it.

The toggle is a **segmented control, not a nav**: no separator between the two
halves (a rule down the middle made them read as two adjacent buttons), both at
32px so they match the answer pills they sit above rather than the sub-tabs they
borrow their markup from, and a filled track behind the pair. The line beside it
is printed in **both** views — only the half that asks you to do something
changes ("review the rest" → "12 inferred by Shipmate") — because the count is
the reason to read the list carefully, and because a line that vanishes changed
the bar's height under the pointer.
