### The card is two columns, top to bottom

Everything in a platform card lands on one of two x values, measured from the
card box: **21** (its 1px border + 20px padding) and **55** (21 + `--pico` +
12). The platform logo's slot, the step discs and the release block's labels
take the first; the platform's name, the step titles and the release values
take the second. The logo and the discs also share a **centre**, 32.

Both of those follow from `--pico`, so tuning the disc moves the text column
with it — that is the design, not a side effect, and it is why there is no
number to keep in sync anywhere else.

```css
--pico:  22px;  /* the step discs — and the logo's SLOT */
--plogo: 26px;  /* the platform logo's glyph, which overflows that slot */
--pname: 19px;  /* the platform's name */
--pstep: 15px;  /* the step titles */
.active-card-platform  { gap: 12px }
.active-card-icon      { width: var(--pico) }
.active-card-icon svg  { width: var(--plogo);
                         margin: 0 calc((var(--pico) - var(--plogo)) / 2) }
```

The reference spec says the logo and the discs are one element at two heights
and must grow together under one variable. That was tried and asking for a
bigger logo grew every checkmark with it, which nobody wanted. The second
attempt gave the logo its own slot and **derived the header's gap**
(`calc(--pico + 12px - --plogo)`) so the name stayed on its column — that
aligned the left edges and left the centres 3px apart, a column of circles
against a bigger logo sitting 3px to their right.

**So the slot is `--pico` and only the glyph is bigger**, overflowing evenly by
a computed negative margin. Centres agree, the column needs no arithmetic, and
either token can move. The cost, on purpose: the glyph's ink starts 2px inside
the card's padding, left of the 21 everything else keeps. For a column that is
otherwise all circles the centre is what the eye reads.

Don't rely on `justify-content: center` to spill an oversized flex item both
ways — it isn't guaranteed. Use the margin.

The logo wears **no well**. It was a 42px rounded square in `--panel-3`, which
made the header the heaviest thing on a card whose every other control is an
outline, and put the mark's ink 6px off the card's only vertical edge.

A `--pcol` token that moved the text column independently of `--pico` was tried
and reverted — the column following the disc is what is wanted. If it ever comes
back, note that the step row's 12px flex gap is the wrong lever: it also spaces
the risk dot from the chevron at the far end of the row.

**Size the glyphs in CSS, never with the size argument.** `smCheckSVG(20)`
appears at nine call sites and `smMarkFor(pid, 20)` at one; all of those
literals were the disc's old fixed size, so the first time `--pico` moved the
ticks silently stopped filling their discs and lost the 38.3% ink ratio the
guide's ticks are matched to. `.ios-step-num svg` and `.active-card-icon svg`
now set the size, so a glyph is a function of its slot.

The step disc is a **soft filled circle**, `rgba(255,255,255,.07)` with the
number at white 42% — no border. The ring it replaced was the last stroked
thing in a card that had had every other stroke removed, and it fought its own
done state: an empty ring turning into a solid green disc is a change of *kind*,
where a soft disc turning green is the same object changing colour. Both risk
states (`is-risk-warn`, `is-risk-high`) therefore tint the **fill**; they used
to tint the border and would otherwise have been silently reduced to a coloured
digit on a neutral disc.

Still open: the guide's pending discs are still rings, so the *pending* state
diverges between the card and the Shippy panel (the tick proportion still
matches).

**The next task wears no ring.** `.gd-task.is-current` used to throw a 1.5px
`--guide-mark` ring around its disc, which reads as "you are here" — a claim the
guide cannot make. `is-current` is derived as the first undone item, while one
tab routinely holds three of them, so it pointed at "Write description" while
you sat on a page containing that and two more. What the guide does know is
which one is NEXT, and that is weight, not a locator: the disc goes to violet
42% (from the pending 20%) and the label comes up out of `--text-dim` to
#cfc4ee, short of the white a *done* label wears. The collapsed rail's
`.guide-mini-dot`s never had the ring, so the two views now agree.
