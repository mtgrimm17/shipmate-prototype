### Versioning — required on every change

Bump **once per publish**, not once per edit — a batch of changes that ships
together is one version. (v5.36→v5.48 burned twelve numbers by bumping on every
tweak; the cost is only cosmetic, but it makes the history unreadable.)

**ONE EXCEPTION: A CACHE THAT HAS ALREADY DIVERGED.** `?v=` is not decoration,
it is the only cache key these files have. A long session of edits under one
unpublished number means a browser that loaded the app early is still holding
those bytes while the files on disk have moved on — and the symptoms are
indistinguishable from real bugs. That is exactly how an afternoon went: a scroll
teleport that had been fixed and measured kept being reported, because the tab
reporting it was running the pre-fix `app.js`. If the file changed and anyone has
loaded the old one, bump. Test with a hard reload before concluding anything
about behaviour that "should" already be fixed.

**BUT THE NUMBER IS A SHARED RESOURCE, AND THAT EXCEPTION COLLIDED WITH IT.** The
bump above was taken mid-session as v6.28 → v6.29 — while Mark was shipping his
own **v6.29, v6.30 and v6.31** from the Distribution side. Two people minted the
same number on the same afternoon, and the local repo had no idea because its
`origin/main` was a day stale. This work went out as v6.32 for that reason, not
v6.29.

**THE FETCH IS FOR WHOEVER WRITES THE NUMBER INTO THE FILES, NOT FOR WHOEVER
RUNS `ship.sh`.** That distinction was missing for a version and the note
quietly became a chore for the wrong person. The workflow at the terminal is
unchanged and is still exactly one command:

```bash
./ship.sh "v6.xx — description of change"
```

`ship.sh` already pulls and rebases; nothing needs to be run before it. The
collision risk belongs to the step BEFORE that — choosing the number, which
happens hours earlier, in a session that may be holding a stale `origin/main`.
When Claude is the one choosing, Claude cannot check: **it is barred from every
git command in this repo** (see Git Workflow). So it either asks, or it picks
and accepts the conflict.

**AND THE CONFLICT IS A REAL BACKSTOP, WHICH IS WHY PICKING BLIND IS SAFE
ENOUGH.** A duplicated number cannot publish quietly: both sides edit the same
fifteen version lines, so `ship.sh`'s rebase conflicts on `index.html` and
`splash.html` *every* time. There is no path where new bytes go live under a
number already taken — the failure this section exists to prevent is caught by
construction. The cost of tripping it is one paste of the conflict and one pass
to resolve it (see "`ship.sh` REBASES" below), not a bad publish.

So: no extra step at the terminal. A fetch is worth it only when someone who
CAN run git is picking the number and happens to know the other side has been
shipping that day.

Current version: **v6.37** → next is **v6.38**, then **v6.39**, etc. (v6.29 –
v6.31 are Mark's Distribution work, shipped in parallel.)

Update the version in **three places**:
1. `index.html` — all `?v=X.XX` cache-bust params on script/style tags (14 of them)
2. `index.html` — the footer badge: `<span class="app-footer-version" id="app-footer-version">vX.XX</span>`
3. `splash.html` — the version badge text (around line 1366)

Note on splash.html: the iframe that used to load it was ported into `splash.js`
back in v2.34, so nothing references `splash.html` any more. Its badge is
updated for consistency only — there is no `src="splash.html?v=X.XX"` to change,
despite what earlier versions of this file said.

Always include the new version number in the ship note, e.g. `"v6.26 — add tooltip to age rating cell"`.

## Security — Read This First

`config.js` is gitignored. It contains real API keys and must never be committed.

```js
// config.js (gitignored — never commit)
const CONFIG = {
  CLAUDE_API_KEY:     'sk-ant-...',
  IGDB_CLIENT_ID:     '...',
  IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET: '...',
};
```

The repo contains placeholder keys in `index.html`:
```js
const CONFIG = {
  CLAUDE_API_KEY:     '__CLAUDE_API_KEY__',
  IGDB_CLIENT_ID:     '__IGDB_CLIENT_ID__',
  IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET: '__IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET__',
};
```

**Never replace these placeholders in index.html with real keys.** Real keys go in `config.js` only.

API keys are injected automatically by GitHub Actions at deploy time — contributors do not need a local `config.js`.

## Git Workflow

**Claude must NOT run any git command in this repo — no `git add`, `commit`, `pull`,
`push`, `gc`, or `maintenance`, and no `rm` of `.git/*.lock`.** The Cowork sandbox is
denied permission to delete files inside `.git` (even ones git itself just created),
so any git operation Claude runs leaves stale `.git/*.lock` files and half-written
`.git/objects/tmp_obj_*` behind. Those leftovers then break the human's `./ship.sh`.
This was the cause of the recurring "index.lock: File exists" failures.

Division of labor:
- **Claude** edits files only, and bumps the version number (see Versioning). Claude
  never commits. When done, Claude tells the contributor to run `./ship.sh`.
- **The contributor** runs everything git via `./ship.sh` from a real terminal (which
  *can* clean up `.git`, and self-heals any stale locks on startup).

Typical workflow:
1. Describe changes to Claude in Cowork — Claude edits the files (no git).
2. Test locally: `python3 -m http.server 8080` → open `http://localhost:8080`
3. Publish: `./ship.sh "v5.xx — description of change"` (commits, pulls, pushes).

GitHub Pages auto-deploys from `main` within ~30 seconds of a push.

Include the version number in the ship note: `./ship.sh "v6.26 — description of change"`.
